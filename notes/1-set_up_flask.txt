----------------------------------- REST API -----------------------------------
Receive requests from a client and respond with data
This particular API will:
    Create stores, each with a name and a list of stocked items
    Create items within a store, each with a name and price
    Given a store name, we can locate the individual store and all its items
    Given a store name we can locate all the items it has stocked 
    Be able to create stores into the database
    Be able to create items 
    And much more 

----------------------------------- Initial Flask Setup -----------------------------------
To create a virtual environment, run 
    python3.10 -m venv .venv 
Then tell VS Code which virtual environment to use, by typing:
    cmd + shift + P 
    Python: Select Interpreter
    Select Python3.10.6 
    Restart your terminal 
The above works when working in the terminal in VS Code
To have the same effect in your terminal, type
    ls .venv/bin/activate
    source .venv/bin/activate

Create 
    app.py 
And inside it, place:
    from flask import Flask 
    app = Flask(__name__)
The latter line will be at the end of the code when all other lines are integrated
This now creates a Flask application
Now, any endpoints defined in the application will be available when we run the application
We run the application by typing
    flask run 
Which generates the following message:
    * Debug mode: off
    WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
    Press CTRL+C to quit
The terminal looks for a file called app.py, and a variable called app 
The warning message is telling us we should not use flask when deploying the application
It shows us that the app is being run locally from http://127.0.0.1:5000 which is port 5000

----------------------------------- JSON -----------------------------------
REST API's usually work with JSON data
It is a large string of data 
It is similar to a Python Dictionary, with Key-Value pairs 
We can select to have it either prettified or not.
The latter is the go-to option as it gives less data to transfer 
It is the data with which clients and servers interact with 

----------------------------------- How To Interact with and Test API's -----------------------------------
We will make use of the application called Insomnia
To use it make sure the FLASK application is running
